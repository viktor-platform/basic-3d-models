This template app demonstrates how to create simple 3D elements and how to combine them into a parametric building, 
using Viktor and Python. You can explore how to visualize 3D elements and create patterns from Viktor inputs to create 
an interactive building.

This app contains:
- Changing the dimensions of the building: the width, length and the number of floors. 
- Changing the color of the building. 
- Viewing the results in a 3D view.
